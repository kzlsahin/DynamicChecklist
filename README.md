# Dynamic Checklist

A checklist page with dynamic filtering system behind according to inputs.
Filtering system has scope based evaluation methods.

 for example:
 "if length of ship is greater than ....."
 "if type of ship is ....."

## Features

 - Several kind of inputs can be defined,
 - Logical expressions can be used to filter the list
 - Reporting of the unchecked items
 - PDF reporting
 - Optionally print the list with all items unchecked and empty reporting field.
 - References to the root document can be inserted.

## Why would I use it?

Especially for automating the filtering process of legal or regulational requirements.

Suppose that you apply for a new passport or anything that has some prerequistes and you want to know what you are supposed to do or which documents should be supplied, while the requirements have wide variety of posibilities and has serious complexity.

A dynamic checklist would ease the job for you.

Or,suppose that you are a civil officer who is supposed to receive applications of such kind. And think that thare may be 2^5 possible situation, maybe more. Then, having this kind of dynamic checklist would do the required logical processing for you.
